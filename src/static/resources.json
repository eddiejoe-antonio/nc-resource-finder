Connect McDowell identified the East Marion community as an area in need of support when it came to student distance learning. It was reported that 69 percent of student households in this community lacked a reliable internet connection, making it one of the most vulnerable and disconnected pockets in McDowell. Project BRIDGE developed a seven-session course curriculum in partnership with McDowell County Schools to teach parents and guardians the skills they needed to communicate with educators and assist their children with online assignments. The classes were taught in English and Spanish by dual language teachers at Eastfield Global Magnet School over the course of two months. The course was widely successful, for 22 people enrolled and ten people completed the course; the majority of participants were Latino-Hispanic.\"",
